# Circular and BI-directional Linked List Lab

Name Akash Dubey

Modify the linkedList you wrote for the previous lab to be circular and bi-directional.  To test your lab, you should be able to print the Magazine rack from front to back or from back to front.  For the circular link, you should be able to print in a loop - A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D, A, B, etc. For the bi-directional, you should be able to print A, B, C, D, or D, C, B, A.  

Your code can be circular and bi-directional, so it can print A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D or D, C, B, A, D, B, C, A.

AS before, use your own LinkedList class, not the one from the Java collections. Also, as before, your Main should have the capability to add a magazine, remove a magazine, and print the list of magazines in the rack.
